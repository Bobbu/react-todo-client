# Todo App
A simple Todo built using React.

## Getting Started

This React client accesses the  FastAPI-based API we produced in Part 1 of Travis Media's tutorial on FastAPI. What is provided here is essentially what was used in Part 3 of the tutorial, starting with an existing React app that was a Todo app and simply tweaking variable names and injecting our API calls.

If you'd prefer to explore a Flutter client, you can visit [flutter_todo_client repo](https://github.com/Bobbu/flutter_todo_client) and clone or download that for your use.

Here are a few resources to get you started on this specific effort:

Start with this 21-minute tutorial to create a Todo API:
Travis Media's [Why You NEED To Learn FastAPI | Hands-On Project](https://youtu.be/cbASjoZZGIw?si=QpsWVHCHM9brUv1K)

I strongly recommend you move on to the second tutorial that moves from an in-memory/transient list of todos to a SQLlite-based persistent one, the tutorial video you can find at Travis' [Dev Importers Community](https://community.travis.media/).

I've publicly shared an implementation of what is taught in the first two tutorials, and I will also make that available here on GitHub.  Clone or download a copy of the [fast-todo repo](https://github.com/Bobbu/fast-todos) if you want to avoid building one yourself.
